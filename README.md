# CS3800 Chat Application Project  

## Running  
To run, just run the main python file and click on the local ip it generates to open the html page in your browser.  

## Todo  
-display username  
-Multiple chatrooms (passwords?), create, join, leave on homescreen and within chatroom  
-Nicer html, colors, interesting shapes or images  


Feel free to add more ideas.

  

### Explanations and Notes  
The code only runs locally for now but the connection between html page (client) and server side in the terminal can be seen.  
Next is getting this working with multiple computers or connections.
