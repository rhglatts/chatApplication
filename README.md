# CS3800 Chat Application Project  

## Running  
To run, just run the main python file and click on the local ip it generates to open the html page in your browser.  

## Todo  
The code only runs locally for now but the connection between html page (client) and server side in the terminal can be seen.  
Next is getting this working with multiple computers or connections.  

### Explanations and Notes  
Made a simple html page to get basic functionality tested because it needs an html page to work. Feel free to make it more fancy.
